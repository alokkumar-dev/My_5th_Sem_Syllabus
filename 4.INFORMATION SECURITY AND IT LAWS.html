</ol>
<h3>INSTRUCTONAL STRATEGY</h3>
The content of this course is to be taught on conceptual basis with real world examples. Since this subject is practice
oriented, the teacher should demonstrate the capabilities of websites/Webpages to students while doing practical
exercises for information security. The students should be made familiar with preventive measures for information and
computer security.
<h3>MEANS OF ASSESSMENT</h3>
Assignments and quiz/class tests, mid-term and end-term written tests<br>
Actual laboratory and practical work, exercises and viva-voce<br>
Software installation, operation, development and viva-voce<br>
