<h3>RATIONALE</h3>
<p>Internet of Things (IoT) is presently a hot technology worldwide. Government, academia, and industry are involved in
different aspects of research, implementation, and business with IoT. IoT cuts across different application domain like
agriculture, space, healthcare, manufacturing, construction, water, and mining. IoT-based applications such as
innovative shopping system, infrastructure management in both urban and rural areas, remote health monitoring and
emergency notification systems, and transportation systems, are gradually relying on IoT based systems. Therefore, it
is very important to learn the fundamentals of this emerging technology. This introductory syllabus will enable
learners to leverage their business and/or technical knowledge across IoT-related functions in the workplace.</p> 
<h3>LEARNING OUTCOMES</h3>

<li>Interfacing Relay module to demonstrate Bluetooth based home automation application. (using Bluetooth and relay).</li>
</ul>
<h3>INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGY</h3>
Some of the topics may be taught using question/answer, assignment, seminar or case study method. The teacher will
discuss case studies with students to feel the importance of the subject , since this subject is practical oriented, the
teacher should demonstrate functioning of various sensors and demonstrate building of IoT applications. Solution to
various regression and classification problems should also be built 
<h3>MEANS OF ASSESSMENT</h3>
Assignments and quiz/class tests, mid-term and end-term written tests<br>
viva-voce<br>
Actual laboratory and practical work exercises<br>
Software installation, operation, development
