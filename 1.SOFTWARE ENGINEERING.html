<h1>5.1 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</h1>
<div><h2>RATIONALE</h2>
<p>The system analysis and design is the backbone of Application software development. After studying the subject the
students will be able to develop and design the system according to given requirements. It involves various steps in
analysis and design of the system. It includes the knowledge of preparing project systematically. It is important to
know about various aspects of the system analysis and design so that the students will be able to understand the
responsibilities while designing and implementing the project.
</p>
<h3>LEARNING OUTCOMES</h3>
